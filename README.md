# Abstract Syntax Tree for CSimple

### Description:
This repository contains the implementation of an abstract syntax tree (AST) for CSimple programs. The project aims to enhance understanding of AST classes, bison's actions, and parser development.

### Key Features:
- Implemented AST classes for CSimple language, including nodes for procedures, assignments, expressions, and more. 
- Utilized bison's actions to build the AST during parsing, following a bottom-up approach. 
- Integrated lexer (lexer.l) and parser (parser.ypp) files to successfully parse CSimple input files and generate the corresponding AST.
- Included support files such as main.cpp, ast2dot.cpp, and others for AST visualization and testing.

### Testing:
Tested locally with provided CSimple test files (test1.lang, test2.lang, test3.lang) and compared AST outputs (test1.pdf, test2.pdf, test3.pdf).
